#Virtual Vending Machine Application

Developed a command line vending machine application. Uses file I/O and includes delimited input file processing. Displays and stores the vending machine's inventory. Updates the inventory as purchases are made. Allows the user to deposit money (one bill at a time), tracks the users balance as purchases are made, and returns the correct change to the user upon completion of purchases. Includes an auto generated sales report ```Audit.txt``` which includes money deposited, purchases made and funds returned to the customer. Includes JUnit testing to verify the methods used.
